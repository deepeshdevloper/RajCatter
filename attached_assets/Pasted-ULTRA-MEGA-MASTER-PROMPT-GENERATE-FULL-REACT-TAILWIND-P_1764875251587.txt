  - 3D food platters with texture maps.
- Provide controls: OrbitControls (zoom, rotate, pan), UI toggles for lighting, gold accent toggle.

- Code should be modular with `Scene.jsx`, `Models.jsx`, and a `Loader` fallback.

N. THEME SELECTOR + AR (ThemeSelectorXR.jsx)
- Theme cards with live preview thumbnails; when available, show 3D preview integrated with Three fiber.

- Floating bubble opens a chat UI that asks guided questions: event date, theme, guest count, budget, menu preference.
- Decision tree logic returns recommended package & call-to-action to book or open planner.
- Store conversation in localStorage; option to send summary to WhatsApp.

P. CUSTOMER PORTAL (PortalAuth.jsx, PortalDashboard.jsx)
- Minimal auth stub using OTP (mock): user enters phone number → receive OTP (generated client-side) → login.
- After login, show portal dashboard:
  - Active bookings
  - Event timeline (progress bar)
  - Assigned staff
  - Invoices (mock)
  - Finalize menu (opens MenuPlanner)

- Allow users to upload audio/video reviews (client-side preview only).
- Show waveform (simple library optional) and play controls.
- Implement moderation note in README.

T. DYNAMIC FOOD COUNTER SIMULATOR (FoodCounterSimulator.jsx)

U. MICRO ANIMATIONS + PAGE TRANSITIONS
- Use framer-motion to build PageTransitionWrapper that wraps pages and animates route changes with gold fade/slide and particle trails.
- Add micro-interactions on buttons and cards: gold shimmer, subtle scale, accessible focus styles.

V. WHATSAPP INTEGRATION
- FloatingWhatsApp.jsx prepares a templated message:
  "Hi Raj Catters, I want catering for {guestCount} guests on {date}. Please share menu & price. - {name}"
- Clicking opens `https://wa.me/<number>?text=` with encoded message.

W. PDF QUOTE GENERATOR
- QuotePDFGenerator.jsx builds a printable quote using html2canvas + jsPDF or html2pdf; includes company branding, menu items chosen, totals, and signature area.
- Support download / email (email using serverless function stub in README).

DELIVERABLES & README
---------------------
Create README.md containing:
- Project overview
- Features list
- Setup:
  1. `npm install`
  2. `npm run dev`
  3. `npm run build`
  4. `npm run preview`
- Environment variables (VITE_OPENAI_KEY, VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY)
- How to replace placeholder assets & logo
- How to deploy to Vercel & Netlify (step-by-step)
- How to enable WebXR & PWA features
- How to connect OpenAI (optional)
- How to replace mock auth with real backend (supabase/next-auth example)
- Security notes (never commit real keys)
- How to test 3D scene locally
- How to replace menuData with real items

EXAMPLES & SAMPLE DATA
----------------------
Create rich sample data files (`/src/data/*.js`) with real-looking menu items, descriptions, prices (placeholders), testimonials, and team bios. Use strong SEO keywords: "Luxury catering in Bhopal", "royal wedding caterers Bhopal", "premium event decoration", etc.

QUALITY & CODING STANDARDS
--------------------------
- Components modular & reusable
- Clear folder naming
- Comments for complex logic
- Use hooks for state management (local state, context for cart/planner, persisting to localStorage)
- Keep bundle size reasonable — lazy load heavy components (ThreeJS, flipbook, PDF generator) with React.lazy + Suspense

FINAL INSTRUCTION TO CODE-GENERATOR
----------------------------------
Produce the full project now. Write all files, components, routing, Tailwind config, sample assets (or clear placeholders), full written content for every page, example data files, and README exactly as defined. Ensure forms have client-side validation and clear stubs for serverless functions. Make the UI extremely premium with the black & gold theme, and ensure cross-device responsiveness.

When generating 3D models, if you cannot produce external 3D assets, create procedural geometry scenes that convey the idea (e.g., stylized platters, stage, decor props) and include comments explaining where to replace with glTF/GLB models. When including OpenAI interactions, use axios with secure environment variable `VITE_OPENAI_KEY` and provide safe usage instructions.
